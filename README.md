Bare soil evaporation measurements were required for two small (1 square meter) test plots.  A small scale precision weighing lysimeters was designed to monitor water balance within the soil tank of the lysimeter, and to compute evaporation from the soil surface.  
Two designs have been developed thus far; a double beam and a single beam lysimeter.  Details of the design, mechanical drawings, CNC G-code, datalogger code, and data interpretations via spreadsheet calculations will be included in the repository.
