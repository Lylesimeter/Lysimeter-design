Two designs have been developed thus far; a double beam (DB) and a single beam (SB) lysimeter.  The DB1818 is a double beam balance with an 18-inch diameter by 18-inch deep soil tank.  The SB1236 is a single beam balance with a 12-inch diameter by 36-inch deep soil tank.

Details of the design, mechanical drawings, CNC G-code, datalogger code, and data interpretations via spreadsheet calculations will be included in the repository.
