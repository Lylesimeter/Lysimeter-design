## Lysimeter Design Spreadsheets

Two designs have been developed thus far; a double beam (DB) and a single beam (SB) lysimeter.  The DB1818 is a double beam balance with an 18-inch diameter by 18-inch deep soil tank.  The SB1236 is a single beam balance with a 12-inch diameter by 36-inch deep soil tank.

Design criteria can be changed in the spreadsheets based on site specific design requirements, such as, soil bulk density, soil tank dimensions, beam fulcrum position, counter weight requirements, etc..
