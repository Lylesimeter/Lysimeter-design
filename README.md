## Lysimeter Design Spreadsheets

Two designs have been developed thus far; a double beam (DB) and a single beam (SB) lysimeter.  The DB1818 is a double beam balance with an 18-inch diameter by 18-inch deep soil tank.  The SB1236 is a single beam balance with a 12-inch diameter by 36-inch deep soil tank.

Design criteria can be changed in the spreadsheets based on site specific design requirements, such as, soil bulk density, soil tank dimensions, beam fulcrum position, counter weight requirements, etc..

Load cell field calibration is performed after the lysimeter is completely installed to account for any site specific conditions.  Laboratory calibration is performed as shown in the example spreadsheet LC_calib_4x.xlsx; known weights are added/subracted in a step-wise fasion (0, 50, 70, 80, 85, 87, 88, 87, 85, 80, 70, 50, 0).  The increased weight simulates soil wetting, while the decreased weight simulated soil drying.  This technique of incrementally adding weight every 3-minutes allows the system to stabilize before moving to the next weight. A comparison of the calibration slopes of the increased weight versus the decreased weight can be used to estimate mechanical hystoresis.
